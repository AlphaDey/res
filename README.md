Hi Raghuram,

I have submitted my resignation and my last working day, as reported by the tool, is 24th January, 2019. I have attached a screenshot from the tool displaying the same.

Additionally, I do want to mention that in the past few days, I have been coaxed and cajoled, have received multiple counter-offers and have witnessed my resignation process getting stalled. However, as mentioned earlier, I am true to my commitment of joining Thomson Reuters and I have gone through my resignation process despite all these resistances.

The reason I have mentioned this is because under these circumstances, it has become difficult for me to negotiate an early release. However, in the next one month, as things cool down, I'll be in a better position to ask for an early release. I'll keep you posted regarding any new developments around my last working day.

Regards,
Arnab
